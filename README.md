#### SQLPage Workout Logger

I am currently building a lightweight, self-hosted workout logger application using [**SQLPage**](https://sql.ophir.dev/ "null"). The goal is to create a simple, data-first tool that is easy to deploy and maintain, focused on progressive overload.

#### Mobile Web App with Google Sheets & Apps Script

I authored a 7-part series on how to create a fully functional, mobile-friendly web application using only Google Sheets as the database and Google Apps Script as the backend.

#### Airline Customer Satisfaction Analysis

An end-to-end data engineering project that builds a logistic regression model to predict airline customer satisfaction. 
The project demonstrates a complete data workflow, including data ingestion, cleaning (imputation, outlier treatment), preprocessing, and rigorous feature selection using VIF analysis and backward stepwise elimination.
