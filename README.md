# Hi, I'm David Rusho

I'm a Data Engineer with a Master's in Data Science.  I enjoy creating automations and playing with data.

### Featured Projects

Here are a couple of projects I'm passionate about:

#### 1. SQLPage Workout Logger

I am currently building a lightweight, self-hosted workout logger application using [**SQLPage**](https://sql.ophir.dev/ "null"). The goal is to create a simple, data-first tool that is easy to deploy and maintain, focused on progressive overload.

- **Repository:** [SQLPage: Workout Logger](https://github.com/drusho/SQLPage-Workout-Logger)
- **Blog Series:** I'm documenting the journey on my website: [Blog article](https://davidrusho.com/b9769618-d27a-409d-b07e-e592f0e0955b)
    

#### 2. Mobile Web App with Google Sheets & Apps Script

I authored a 7-part series on how to create a fully functional, mobile-friendly web application using only Google Sheets as the database and Google Apps Script as the backend.
